# **Partial Differential Equations: Poisson's Problem**

This is an open source small project that enables you to discover Poisson's problem as an interesting 
example of a PDE.

This work combines two methods to solve Poisson's problem:

- **First method:** Applying Finite differences method.

- **Second method:** Applying a small chage of variables and to make the Poisson's problem a linear system 
problem.
